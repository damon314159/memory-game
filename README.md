# Memory Game

A simple project to implement concepts of managing state with useState and useEffect.

To get started with the project, clone the repo. Then run `npm i` to install deps, and finally `npm run dev` to begin a dev server.

## The game

The idea is simple. There are some number of cards on the screen. You have to click on them, a point for each you click. Your score resets when you click a card you've already clicked. Can you remember what you've pressed and get the max score?
